**MobileGlues**, which stands for "(on) Mobile, GL uses ES", is a GL implementation running on top of host OpenGL ES 3.1, with running Minecraft Java Edition in mind.

Features
====

1. Capable of running Minecraft [Sodium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium) mod;

2. Capable of rendering most minecraft shaders with Minecraft [Iris](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris) mod or [Optifine](https://optifine.net/home).

3. Capable of running some Minecraft mods with custom rendering routines, such as [JourneyMap](https://teamjm.github.io/journeymap-docs/latest) and [Create](https://createmod.net).

Call to Action
====

Since we are a small team, we cannot own every distinct device and do through tests on them.

If you are interested in this project, please consider contributing to the project by:

Filling out the [mod support matrix](https://github.com/Swung0x48/MobileGlues-release/blob/main/ModSupportMatrix.md) or [shader  support matrix](https://github.com/Swung0x48/MobileGlues-release/blob/main/ShaderSupportMatrix.md)!

We need your help to test the compatibility of shaders and mods, and a broad variety of devices!

> [!NOTE]
> How to fill out the table
> 
> You may:
> 
> - Add a new device to the table, by appending a new row to the table. (You can get device codename from `adb shell getprop ro.product.name`)
> - Add a new item to the table, by appending a new column to the table. (Make sure you have modify all the rows to add the column!)
> - Fill out the table with the compatibility of the item on the device, by marking the cell with
>     - a checkmark (✅) if the item is compatible, 
>     - or a cross (❌) if the item is fully not compatible (and file an issue/link to the issue). 
>     - If the item is not tested (not included in your modpack/you do not install this mod), mark the cell with a question mark (?).
>     - a asterisk (*️⃣) if the item is working, but have missing features and/or have graphical glitches (and file an issue/link to the issue).
> - If applicable, you may want to mention what additional drivers/plugins rather than the one vendor provides, are in use (such as turnip drivers, ANGLE, etc.) in the "Additional Drivers/Plugins in use" column.
> - If applicable, you should add a file named `*device_codename*.md`, to provide additional information, and put the link in the last column.
